# SpotifyPartyQueue
SpotifyPartyQueue is a lightweight web application that lets multiple users collaboratively manage a shared Spotify queue.
Participants can add tracks via Spotify URLs and vote on which songs should play next â€” perfect for parties, group events, or shared listening sessions.

### How to vote for a song? 
- Search the song you would like to vote for in the "Aktuelle Queue" in the SpotifyPartyQueue (if it doesn't exist, add it like described before)
- Select a smiley to vote (default vote is neutral). The number at the right indicates how what's the current total vote for the song is (higher is better)

- The song at the top of the "Aktuelle Queue" will be added next to the spotify playing queue
- You can change your vote at any time. 

## Setup
You need to Setup the spotify-API for your account and the server which hosts front- and backend. The application will start working as soon as you play songs on any device. You can e.g. play a "basic playlist" and users can add special songs/wishes through the SpotifyPartyQueue.
